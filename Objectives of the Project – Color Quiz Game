To Create an Interactive Learning Tool
The main objective of this project is to develop an engaging quiz-based application that helps users test and improve their knowledge about colors through interactive multiple-choice questions.

To Enhance User Engagement through a GUI-Based Platform
The project aims to design a simple and attractive graphical interface using Python’s Tkinter library, allowing users to interact easily with questions, submit answers, and view their progress in real time.

To Implement Randomization and Logical Control
The system incorporates random selection of questions and event-driven programming concepts to ensure that each quiz session feels unique and dynamic, enhancing both usability and replay value.

To Encourage Self-Assessment and Knowledge Retention
By allowing users to attempt questions, check correctness, and view their scores, the application promotes interactive learning, helping users retain knowledge more effectively compared to traditional methods.

To Apply Python Programming Concepts in a Real-World Context
This project provides practical exposure to Python programming, GUI development, and logical design. It demonstrates how fundamental programming skills can be applied to build educational and entertaining software applications.
